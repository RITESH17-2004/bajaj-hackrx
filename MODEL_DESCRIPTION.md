# Model Description

## What Our Model Does

This is an **LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System** designed for document analysis and question answering, specifically optimized for insurance, legal, HR, and compliance documents.

## How It Works

### 1. Document Processing
- Takes document URLs (PDF, DOCX, emails)
- Extracts and chunks text into semantic segments
- Generates embeddings using sentence-transformers

### 2. Query Processing
- Processes natural language questions
- Performs semantic similarity search using FAISS vector store
- Identifies query intent (coverage, timing, information)

### 3. Answer Generation
- Uses LLM (Mistral AI, Hugging Face, or fallback engine)
- Provides contextual answers with confidence scores
- Includes source traceability and reasoning

### 4. Decision Engine
- Analyzes retrieved chunks for relevance
- Generates concise, accurate answers (under 50 words)
- Post-processes responses for clarity

## Key Features

- **Multi-format support**: PDF, DOCX, email documents
- **Semantic search**: Vector-based similarity matching
- **Explainable AI**: Confidence scores and source references
- **Token optimization**: Efficient prompt engineering
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Multiple LLM options with graceful degradation

## Architecture Flow

```
Document URL → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embeddings → Vector Store
Query → Intent Analysis → Similarity Search → LLM Processing → JSON Response
```

The system is designed for high accuracy, low latency (<2s), and cost-effective token usage while providing explainable decision-making for domain-specific document analysis.
